            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Kami arrived on Earth as a young Namekian after being sent away from his home planet during a climate
                disaster. Initially, he sought to become the Guardian of Earth but had to purge his inner evil, which
                created his dark counterpart, Piccolo Daimao (King Piccolo).
            </p>
            <p>
                Once purified, Kami ascended to the role of Guardian, creating the Dragon Balls as a means to help
                humanity. His relationship with Piccolo remains a central part of his story, culminating in their
                eventual fusion to face greater threats.
